A software built using Visual Basic to store media files(image, audio and video files) in a database for easy storage management, retrieval, searching and playback.
<br>
The software is built using Visual Basic 6.0 as part of my software tools coursework. It uses a Microsoft Access database to store media files as BLOB datatypes. However the database has been deleted here due to its ungainly size. So before running the software please create a database.
